Assumptions
1) Every node will be connected to every other
2) Data redistribution can only happen when every node agrees the IDs
- a new node can join while a redistribution is going on; it will then be interrupted and restarted when the
IDs are settled again

Startup process:
1) New node starts up and sends greet message to Multicast socket
- special case - what if this is the first node??
- tells everyone it's tcp port
2) Other nodes respond with
- what they think this new node's ID should be
- their own ID (null if not set yet)
- the port on which their TCP server is listening (assume it's the same IP)
3) New node picks highest id as it's id
- if there are any nulls, or a greet comes in to a node that doesn't know it's ID yet, all involved nodes
know that this situation is occuring. They can each assign an ID unambiguously by ordering by IP address and then port.
